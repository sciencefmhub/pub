ABSTRACT BODY: The NASA QuakeSim program unites many components of earthquake fault data and modeling toward short-term forecasts of major earthquake events. The QuakeTables component enables widespread web access to multiple self-consistent earthquake fault models and an increasing set of GPS and InSAR dispalcement data. These data are ingested by a variety of QuakeSim models and pattern analysis techniques, including elastic half space inversions, finite element continuum models, Hidden Markov models and Pattern Informatics-based forecasting methods. These tools are migrating to Web 2.0 tools, such as Google Gadgets.
