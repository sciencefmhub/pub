Abstract


The Grid, or Grid Computing, provides a new and unrivalled technology
for large scale distributed simulation as it enables collaboration and
the use of distributed computing resources. Last year at DS-RT 2004 a
panel was convened to consider the impact of the Grid on Distributed
Simulation. Four members presented their views of this area and
together they tried to identify the main research issues involved in
applying Grid technology to distributed simulation and the key future
challenges that need to be solved to achieve this goal. These
challenges included not only technical ones, but also social ones such
as management methodology and the development of standards. This year
we revisit this fast changing technology and ask the questions:

 * What major changes has Grid Computing had over the past year?
 * How can distributed simulation and related applications benefit    
   from Grid Computing?
 * What are the barriers to this?
 * Are there alternative new technologies that would be a better ROI 
   for distributed simulation than Grid Computing?
