An Introduction to the TeraGrid Track 2D Systems: Future Grid, Gordon,
and Keeneland

Presenters: Robert Sinkovits, Renato Figueiredo, Jeffrey Vetter

Level: Introductory

Length: Full day

Time: 8:00am - 5:00pm

Abstract: This tutorial will consist of a series of three sessions, each
focusing on one of the Track 2D systems: Future Grid, Gordon, and
Keeneland. Each session will start with a brief overview of the
performance metrics and overall organization of the system, with an
emphasis on the unique architectural features. The majority of the time
though will be spent addressing the issues that impact end users and
application developers. We will describe the types of codes, algorithms,
and middleware that are expected to run well on each system. Where
applicable, this will be based on the results of benchmarking studies
carried out on the production hardware or early prototypes. We will then
cover the use of performance monitoring tools and techniques for
achieving better performance. Programming techniques and important
features of languages extensions and run-time environments (e.g. OpenMP,
CUDA, Hadoop/MapReduce) needed to efficiently use the machine will also
be described. Each session will conclude with advice on writing a
successful allocations proposal, stressing the need to provide a strong
justification for access to the requested resource.
