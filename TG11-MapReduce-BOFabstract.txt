  MapReduce applications and environments


      Time:

5:30pm - 7:00pm


      Abstract:

As the computing landscape becomes increasingly data-centric,
data-intensive computing environments are poised to transform scientific
research. In particular, MapReduce based programming models and run-time
systems such as the open-source Hadoop system have increasingly been
adopted by researchers with data-intensive problems, in areas including
bio-informatics, data mining and analytics, and text processing. While
Map/Reduce run-time systems such as Hadoop are currently not supported
across all TeraGrid systems (it is available on systems including
FutureGrid), there is increased demand for these environments by the
science community. This BOF session will provide a forum for discussions
with users on challenges and opportunities for the use of MapReduce. It
will be moderated by Geoffrey Fox who will start with a short overview
of MapReduce and the applications for which it is suitable. These
include pleasingly parallel applications and many loosely coupled data
analysis problems where we will use genomics, information retrieval and
particle physics as examples.

We will discuss the interest of users, the possibility of using Teragrid
and commercial clouds, and the type of training that would be useful.
The BOF will assume only broad knowledge and will not need or discuss
details of technologies like Hadoop, Dryad, Twister, Sector/Sphere
(MapReduce variants)
