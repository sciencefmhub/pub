I don't care where my data and methods are: A web-service approach
for distributed access to methods, data and models.

In recent years cheminformatics has been enhanced with the public
availability and accesibility of methods and chemical and biological
data.  This talk will highlight recent progress on the development of a
web service based infrastructure to provide  uniform and distributed
access to methods, data and models in a general manner.  I will focus on
the use of the infrastructure to provide access to a variety of
statistical methods and predictive models, highlighting a number of
applications based on these services. In addition to providing access to
data, it is useful to add value to current data sources. I will
present a shape searchable, single conformer, 3D derivative of PubChem
allowing one to retrieve similar shaped molecules in 10 to 30 sec
depending on similarity cutoffs. I will discuss  some approaches that
will allow us to include arbitrary numbers of conformers yet still
maintain reasonable query times.
